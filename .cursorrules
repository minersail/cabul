# Vocab Herald - AI Assistant Rules

## Context Loading (Start of Every Conversation)
Always begin by reading:
1. README.md - for current project status and implementation state
2. prisma/schema.prisma - for database structure
3. package.json - for dependencies and available scripts

## Project Overview
French vocabulary learning app: Articles  Tokenization  Word-by-word learning  Progress tracking
Tech stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Supabase + Prisma

## Documentation Maintenance
Update README.md whenever you:
- Complete major features or components
- Add/modify database schema
- Implement new integrations or APIs
- Change core learning workflows
- Add environment variables or setup steps
- Reach development milestones

Keep these README sections current:
- Implementation Status (completed/in-progress/planned)
- Recent Changes (with dates)
- Architecture Overview
- Setup instructions

Important: Keep additions to README concise. Prefer adding to existing sections, rather than
adding new sections. Avoid adding trivial information. The purpose of the README is for you
to keep track of features and complexity, to best provide context for yourself in the future.
Optimize the README for precise context for an AI model, not for a human reader.

If you feel it adequate, you may add additional documentation in the docs/ folder to describe
behavior you deem complex and important, so that you may go in depth without crowding the README.

## Development Patterns
- Use reducer patterns for complex state management
- Use Prisma for all database operations, implemented as server actions
- Use the useAuth() hook for operations involving the user
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing error handling patterns
